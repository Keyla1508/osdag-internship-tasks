Submission for Osdag Internship â€“ Task-2= = Develop a CAD drawing with PythonOCC of a Laced Compound Column as shown in the representative image.

#NOTE!!
Use Anaconda 'occenv' interpreter for the libraries, i was unable to find libraries in normal pip install

This was the most time-consuming and challenging task for me. As I had never used coding for CAD, it was a very new experience, a challenge, and a steep learning curve!
This Task has 3 files
#1 draw_i_section.py
#2 draw_rectangular_prism.py
#3 portal_frame.py

#1 is a simple program, it replicates real-life ISBM 200
#2 is another simple program to make 'bars' for that 'Z' part
#3 was the most difficult and time-consuming. New plates were made, and everything was fused to create Laced Compound Column
